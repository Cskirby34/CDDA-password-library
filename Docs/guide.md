step 3 - making the password and site/email
This part is more tedious as you will have to manually add the information of the following:
The website it’s for
The username
And finally add the password
Note: you can also generate a new random password for the site or for one you will make in the future. You can also change it to your liking as well.
After you finish making your entry, click the save entry and it will be added to the vault.

Step 4 - saving the vault
This step is simple, after adding an entry, you will have to save the vault to prevent it from being gone forever. Click the save vault to save and then you can press the lock button to close it afterwards. To open the vault againagain, type in the password for the vault.
